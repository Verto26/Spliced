Something happens and the timelines squish together. 


Main hero, saving female from bad environment
Reunite instead of rescue

(Chrono Trigger- Esque)

Art changes dependent on time change. (Dependent on ticks?)

-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Avoid "You're the hero, you're going to save the world"


Use a PvE and as a shorter story due to time 

	1. Look for motivation for the main player
		Running away from something (Mobs/etc)
		Chasing after something (GF/Princess/Love Interest)
			Go back and fix things back in time
				Save someone?
					Potential opportunity to run through the timelines and stop his family from dying in a terrible catastrophic event.
	2. Main Character - 
		a. Time Frame
			i. Current Era, (2018)
		b. Personality Trait
			i. What drives him? (A.D. Sig other death)
			ii. What scares him? (Death reaching him, Loneliness)
			iii. Background? Blue Collar Gamer?
				1) Clothing
				2) How he walks
				3) Demeanor
	3. Main Goal
		a. Family Members
			i. Background information about them as a flashback or explanation upon the story.
			ii. *** Might not actually talk about the time schism but it would be good for us to know why it's actually happening.
	4. Explanation
		a. Build the relationship between the  two characters and then it gets crushed and it becomes a revenge/investigative story.
		b. Crazy Loonies "I heard such-and-such organization actually was able to create rifts through time but something didn’t go quite right…"
		c. Driving down the road running from things and get ran off the road and sig other dies. 
		d. Scientific *snap*  happens and character loses family into time rift and get split from them. Family would be in the same time frame.
		e. Historic building survives and time is bleeding through into present.
